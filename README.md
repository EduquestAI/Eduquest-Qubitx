*Enjoy a world where education is guided by YOUR passions and preferences.*

## About Us

Eduquest is a collaborative effort to build an AI-powered interest-based learning platform. We believe in a future where education is tailored to individual interests, fostering a deeper love for learning. This has statistically been proven to be 20% more affective towards students education and would be amazing if expanded to more than just basic education subjects.

## Our Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize education by providing personalized learning experiences that empower individuals to pursue their interests and achieve their full potential, all the while having fun and not dreading their learning experience.

## Current Status

Eduquest is a work in progress. While most of our code is currently private, we're actively developing and refining our platform behind the scenes. Stay tuned for updates!
